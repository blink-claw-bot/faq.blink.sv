# What does the 'Unsupported phone carrier for quiz' error mean?

The "Unsupported phone carrier for quiz" error that appears while using the Earn feature indicates that the phone number registered to your account originates from a restricted area. This limitation is not related to your account specifically but is necessary to curb malicious activities from that region. We are unable to offer a workaround at this time. However, we are exploring future enhancements to the Earn feature that would allow its use without involving payments.\
