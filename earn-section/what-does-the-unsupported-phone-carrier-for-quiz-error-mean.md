# What does the 'Unsupported phone carrier for quiz' error mean?

The "Unsupported phone carrier for quiz" error that appears while using the Earn feature indicates that either:
* you have removed the phone number from your Login Methods. You can use Earn again if you verify your phone number again. Add your phone number back in the Blink app `Settings` - under `Login Methods` - `Tap to add phone number`.
* the phone number registered to your account originates from a restricted area. This limitation is not related to your account specifically, but is necessary to curb malicious activities from that region. We are unable to offer a workaround at this time. However, we are exploring future enhancements to the Earn feature that would allow its use without involving payments.
