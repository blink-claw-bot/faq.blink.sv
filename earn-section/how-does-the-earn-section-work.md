# How does the earn section work?

The Earn Section of Blink is a fun way for our users to earn sats by learning the basics about bitcoin.

Go to the Earn section of your Blink (bottom right). Answer the questions correctly to earn some sats that will appear automatically on your wallet.

You can only earn the sats when you complete the quiz the first time and there is only one chapter available per day. Nevertheless, once have been through it once you can always come back for a refresh read!
