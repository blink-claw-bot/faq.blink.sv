# Earn Section

The Earn Section of Blink is a gamified educational feature that rewards users with sats for learning about Bitcoin. By accessing the Earn section in the bottom right of Blink app, users can answer a series of questions related to money, bitcoin and its underlying technology.

Each correct answer earns the user a predetermined amount of sats, which are automatically credited to their wallet upon completion. This not only encourages users to expand their knowledge about bitcoin, but also allows them to accumulate sats without having to invest additional funds.
