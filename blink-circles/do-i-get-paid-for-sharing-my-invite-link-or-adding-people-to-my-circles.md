# Do I get paid for sharing my invite link or adding people to my circles?

No, there is no standard reward for sharing your link or growing your circle.

Instead you can participate in monthly circles challenges to earn sats, SWAG, conference tickets and other items.

Circles challenges are intended to reward real individuals for educating and onboarding other people to Bitcoin and Blink. There are measures in place to detect misuse and abuse of the program, and Blink reserves the right to withhold rewarding any accounts suspected of this behavior. If you believe that a reward has been improperly withheld, send an email with the subject “Circles Reward” to support@blink.sv. In the email, provide your username and/or phone number associated with the account.
