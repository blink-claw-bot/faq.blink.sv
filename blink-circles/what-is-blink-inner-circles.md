# What are Inner Circles?

Your **Inner Circle** consists of all the Blink users whom you have personally introduced to the world of Bitcoin by sending them their first satoshis from your Blink account to their Blink account.

Each new Blink user can be a part of only one person's inner circle. You can expand your inner circle by being the first to send more people sats through Blink. This unique concept fosters a sense of connection and growth within the Blink community.
