# What should I do if I don't receive an SMS?

If you don't receive the SMS text to complete your Blink registration, make sure your phone has international SMS text messaging permissions or is connected to the internet to receive the confirmation code via WhatsApp.

Check the following steps:&#x20;

* **Check Signal and Coverage:** Ensure you have strong signal and network coverage.
* **Restart Connection:** Try restarting your connection by toggling Airplane mode on and off.
* **Login with email instead:** If you have already associated an email with your account, you can use it to log in instead of SMS verification.
* **Check Phone Number:** Double-check if you entered your phone number correctly. If there's a typo, correct it and try again.
* **Wait for Retry:** Blink allows up to 4 attempts per 3 days for SMS delivery. If you have already exceeded this limit, you will need to wait until the cooldown period expires before trying again.
