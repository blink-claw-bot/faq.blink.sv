# What should I do if I don't receive an SMS?

If you don't receive the SMS text to complete your Blink registration, make sure your phone has international SMS text messaging permissions or is connected to the internet to receive the confirmation code via WhatsApp.

* **Check Signal Strength:** Ensure that your mobile device has a strong signal and is connected to the network.
* **Verify Phone Number:** Double-check that the phone number associated with your Blink account is correct and up to date.
* **Check Spam Folder:** Sometimes SMS messages can be filtered into your device's spam or junk folder. Check these folders to see if the SMS landed there.
* **Wait for Retry:** Blink allows up to 4 attempts per 3 days for SMS delivery. If you have already exceeded this limit, you will need to wait until the cooldown period expires before trying again.

If you still haven't received the confirmation code after three attempts, please contact Blink support for direct assistance.
