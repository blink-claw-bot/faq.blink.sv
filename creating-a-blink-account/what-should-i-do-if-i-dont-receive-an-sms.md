# What should I do if I don't receive an SMS?

If you don't receive the SMS text to complete your Blink registration, make sure your phone has international SMS text messaging permissions or is connected to the internet to receive the confirmation code via WhatsApp.

If you still haven't received the confirmation code after three attempts, please contact Blink support for direct assistance.
