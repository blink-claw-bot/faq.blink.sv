# Why can't I complete the puzzle to receive SMS?

If you are having difficulty completing the puzzle to receive an SMS, it could be due to issues with your phone's touchscreen, puzzle does not display correctly or because too many unsuccessful attempts have been made. In such cases, Blink may temporarily block further attempts for security reasons. &#x20;

We suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the app but if the same problem persists please contact Blink's support team for assistance.&#x20;
