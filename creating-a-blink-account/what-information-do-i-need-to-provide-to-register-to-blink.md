# What information do I need to provide to register to Blink?

To create a Blink account, you'll need a phone number with international SMS text messaging permissions or WhatsApp and an internet connection.&#x20;

Once you've entered your phone number, you'll receive an SMS or WhatsApp text message for account authentication. After that, you can create an optional unique username for Lightning Address and internal Blink transactions.

If you don't have access to SMS messaging, we also offer WhatsApp as a verification option.

Please note that the username you create will be visible to other Blink users, so we recommend choosing your username with this in mind.
