# What information do I need to provide to register to Blink?

None. You only need a smartphone and internet access. You just download the App and open it. What gets created at that instant is a Trial account that has full abilities to send and receive btc by lightning within certain limits. You do not have to do anything more but we recommend you create a username, and add a phone number and email address, but this is not needed yet, until you need to increase your limits.

Once you've entered your phone number, you'll receive an SMS or WhatsApp text message for account authentication. After that, you can create an optional unique username for Lightning Address and internal Blink transactions.

Please note that the username you create will be visible to other Blink users, so we recommend choosing your username with this in mind.

Once registered it is recommended to [add an email address](/creating-a-blink-account/how-do-i-create-an-account-with-blink.md#add-an-email-address-(optional)) which you can use to log in going forward.
