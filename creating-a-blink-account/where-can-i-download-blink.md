# Where can I download Blink?

Blink is currently available for download on the app stores of all major mobile operating systems and phone manufacturers, including [Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.galoyapp)(version 7 or higher), [Huawei](https://appgallery.huawei.com/#/app/C105387593), and [iPhone.](https://apps.apple.com/ng/app/bitcoin-beach-wallet/id1531383905) The easiest way to find Blink in app stores is via the download buttons on [blink.sv](https://blink.sv).&#x20;

If you are unable to find the app on these stores, it may be due to one of the following reasons:

* Your app store may be registered in a country that does not allow the download or use of this type of wallet due to internal regulations. Examples of such countries include the USA and North Korea.
* On some Huawei phones, you may need to install Google Play Services and Google Play Store before you can download the app.

Users of Graphene, CalyxOS and other Android devices can [download and install Blink directly via APK](https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy-mobile/releases).

Please note that the availability of the app may vary depending on your location and device, so it's always a good idea to check the app store first
