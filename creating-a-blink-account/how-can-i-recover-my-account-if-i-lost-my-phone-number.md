# How can I recover my account if I lost my phone number?

Currently, we are unable to recover accounts solely through lost phone numbers due to security reasons. This is why it's crucial to associate an email address with your Blink account during the initial setup. By adding an email address to your account, you ensure that you can still access your Blink account even if you lose your phone number.

To add or update your email address, follow these steps:

1. Open the Blink app and navigate to Settings.
2. Go to the Account section.
3. Select "Email" and enter your preferred email address.
4. Verify your email address through the confirmation link sent to your email inbox.

Once your email address is linked to your Blink account, you can use it to sign in and manage your account securely. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please reach out to Blink support for help.
