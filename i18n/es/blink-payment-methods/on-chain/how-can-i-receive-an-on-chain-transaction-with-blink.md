# ¿Cómo puedo recibir una transacción on-chain con Blink?

Para recibir una transacción on-chain utilizando Blink, siga estos pasos:

1. Open the Blink app and click on `Receive`
2. Under the QR code click on `Onchain`
3. You can copy the address, share it, or show the QR code to the sender. Note that to avoid address reuse there will be a new address displayed when you have received a transaction on the address shared previously. The old address will remain valid to receive transactions on your account even when there is a new address shown.
4. Once the transaction has been sent, the transaction should shortly appear as `Pending` in your wallet. Click on the transaction to see it's \`Transaction Hash\`. Using the Transaction Hash (also known as TXID) you can see the details of the transaction in a block explorer like [mempool.space](https://mempool.space) and see when it is confirmed in a block.
