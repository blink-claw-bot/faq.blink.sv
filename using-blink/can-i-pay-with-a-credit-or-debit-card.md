# Can I pay with a credit or debit card?

No, Blink is a Bitcoin wallet that allows you to send and receive Bitcoin (BTC) payments with Lightning and onchain. You can use Blink to pay for goods and services at any business that accepts Bitcoin.

However in selected countries you can buy and sell Bitcoin through Blink with a bank transaction, see: [How do I cash out my Blink funds](https://faq.blink.sv/using-blink/how-do-i-cash-out-my-blink-funds)
