# Upgrading from a Trial account to level 1

Running Blink on some phones (running an unmodified, stock OS) makes it possible to open a Trial account without even using a phone number.

A Trial account has low transactions limits and not allowed to send or receive on-chain.

Upgrading to a level 1 account comes with benefits:

* &#x20;increased transaction limits
* &#x20;ability to recover the account using the registered phone number with SMS / WhatsApp or email
* enable functions like on-chain send and receive, setting a username, lightning address, Point of Sale / Cash Register webpage,  static paycode etc.


To upgrade from the Trial account (level 0) to level 1 you will need to verify a phone number using SMS or WhatsApp:

1. In the Blink Wallet with the Trial account select the menu on the top right and tap `Account`
2. select `Backup/upgrade account`
3. complete the account set up with a phone number


It is recommended to add an email address as well so you can recover with email and don't need to rely on the phone number:

To add and email login (only available if a phone number was added previously):

1. select the menu on the top right and tap `Account`
2. select `Email (for login)`
3. enter an email address and complete the verification to enable login with email
