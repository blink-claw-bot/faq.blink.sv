# Why do I see a balance of 0 when I log in to my account?

If you are seeing a balance of 0 when you log in to your account, it could be due to using an incorrect phone number associated with your account and you actually just created a new account. Please ensure that you are logging in with the correct phone number that is linked to your account.&#x20;

Here’s what you can do:

1. **Verify Phone Number:** Double-check if you are using the correct phone number associated with your Blink account.
2. **Try Alternate Methods:** If you have associated an email with your account, you can try logging in using your email instead of your phone number.
