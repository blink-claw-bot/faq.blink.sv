# How do I send a transaction with Blink?

Blink provides an easy way to send Bitcoin transactions using both on-chain and Lightning networks. To send a transaction, you can do the following:

* Enter the recipient's on-chain address (starting with bc1) or a Lightning invoice (starting with lnbc1).
* Alternatively, you can use the recipient's Lightning Address which looks like an email address (e.g. username@blink.sv) or the username of another Blink user to make the payment.
* Finally, you can confirm the transaction details and send the payment.
