# What are the fees for receiving Bitcoin in my Blink wallet?

When you receive an **on-chain transaction** in your Blink wallet, there is no fee charged to you by Blink. However, the person who is sending you the transaction will need to pay a miner fee to ensure that the transaction is confirmed and processed by the network. This miner fee is not retained by Blink.

Similarly, when you receive a **Lightning transaction** in your Blink wallet, there is no fee charged to you by Blink. However, the person who is sending you the transaction will need to pay a LN routing fee to cover the cost of routing the payment through the Lightning Network. This routing fee is not retained by Blink.
