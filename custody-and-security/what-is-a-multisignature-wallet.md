# What is a Multisignature Wallet?

\
**Multisignature** (multisig) is a security mechanism that involves multiple private keys to authorize a Bitcoin transaction. Instead of a single private key controlling the transaction, multisig requires two or more private keys to sign off on a transaction before it can be executed. This adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access and potential theft of funds.

While it's true that the principles of Bitcoin emphasize individual control of one's private keys, there are still valid reasons to use a custodian like Blink. Custodial wallets can offer additional security measures such as multisig, which can provide an extra layer of protection for users' funds. Additionally, using a custodian can provide peace of mind for users who may be less experienced with managing their own private keys or who simply prefer the convenience and ease of use that a custodial wallet can offer. Ultimately, the choice between self-custody and a custodial wallet comes down to individual preferences and risk tolerance
