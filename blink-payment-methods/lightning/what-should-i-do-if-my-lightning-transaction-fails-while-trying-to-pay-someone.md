# What should I do if my Lightning transaction fails while trying to pay someone?

If your Lightning transaction fails while trying to pay someone, the most common reason could be insufficient funds to pay the invoice. Make sure you have sufficient funds in the account you want to send from and don't forget to account for network fees.

Another reason could be the failure to find a route to send the transaction to the destination Lightning node. In such cases, you can try again after a short period or ask the recipient of your payment to provide an invoice from another wallet.&#x20;

If the issue persists, you may reach out to customer support for assistance in resolving the issue.
