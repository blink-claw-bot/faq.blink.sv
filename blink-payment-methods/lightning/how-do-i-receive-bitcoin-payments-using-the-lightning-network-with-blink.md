# How do I receive bitcoin payments using the Lightning Network with Blink?

To receive a bitcoin payment using the Blink through the Lightning Network, simply follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Receive" button on the main screen of the app.
2. Choose whether you want to receive the payment to your bitcoin or Stablesats account
3. If you want to request a specific amount, enter the amount you wish to receive in the designated field.
4. Set a note or label to remember what you have spent your money on.
5. You can send a zero amount invoice, but it may not always work depending on the wallet the sender is using. For example, some wallets like Muun always require invoice with amount.
