# What should I do if my Lightning transaction status is pending?

If your Lightning transaction is showing a pending status, the best course of action is to wait. In Lightning Network transactions, there are two possible outcomes for a pending transaction: success or cancellation.

* If the transaction is successful, the funds will be transferred as intended.
* If the transaction is cancelled for any reason (such as a timeout), the funds will be automatically refunded to your wallet.

Please be patient while the transaction status updates. If you encounter repeated issues with Lightning transactions, consider checking your internet connection and ensuring your wallet software is up to date.
