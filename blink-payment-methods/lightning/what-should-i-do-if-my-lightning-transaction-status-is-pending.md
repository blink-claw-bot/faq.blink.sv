# What should I do if my Lightning transaction status is pending?

If your Lightning transaction is showing a pending status, the best course of action is to wait. In Lightning Network transactions, there are two possible outcomes for a pending transaction: success or cancellation.

* If the transaction is successful, the funds will be transferred as intended.
* If the transaction is cancelled for any reason (such as a timeout), the funds will be automatically refunded to your wallet.

The change of status could take up to two weeks.&#x20;
