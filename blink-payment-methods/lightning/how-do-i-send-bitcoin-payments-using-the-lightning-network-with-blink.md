# How do I send bitcoin payments using the Lightning Network with Blink?

To send bitcoin using the Lightning Network with the Blink, you have two options:

**Option 1:** If you are close to the receiver, you can click on the "Scan QR Code" button on the main screen of the app and scan the receiver's Lightning invoice.

**Option 2:** Click on the "Send" button on the main screen of the app and paste the Lightning invoice, the Blink username, or the LNURL of the receiver. If the invoice you received from the receiver already has an amount specified, you do not need to add an amount. However, if the amount is not specified, you can add the amount you wish to send in the designated field.
