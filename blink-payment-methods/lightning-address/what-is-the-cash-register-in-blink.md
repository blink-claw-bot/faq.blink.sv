# What is the Cash Register in Blink?

The Cash Register in Blink is a convenient way to receive bitcoin payments in a Point of Sale (POS) setting. It's especially useful for merchants to receive payments directly into their wallets, without relying on a single device, making it an easy and cost-effective way to have a functioning POS in their stores.

To use the Cash Register, click the menu in the top right of your Blink home screen and go to "Ways to get paid". Here you will find the link to your Cash Register, e.g. pay.blink.sv/username&#x20;

* You can open the Cash Register link in any browser and create Lightning invoices in a quick and easy way.&#x20;
* You can share the Cash Register link with your customers: when a customer opens the link, they will be directed to Cash Register where they can enter the amount they wish to pay and complete the transaction.
* You can share the Cash Register link with your employees or staff and let them receive payments on your behalf. Keep in mind, that any amount sent to invoices generated in your unique Cash Register goes directly into your Blink account. The Cash Register is only for receiving payments, not sending. The funds in your Blink account can only increase, never decrease, when you share it with an employee or customer.

The cash register feature also provides a simple way to keep track of your sales and generate reports to help you keep track of your business transactions.
