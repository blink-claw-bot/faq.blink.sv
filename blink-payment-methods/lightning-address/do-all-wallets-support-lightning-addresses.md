# Do all wallets support Lightning Addresses?

Many popular wallets have added support for Lightning Addresses, but there are still some that don't support it.&#x20;

Quite many Lightning wallets support sending to a Lightning Address. Fewer Lightning wallets can provide a Lightning Address to their users to receive payments.&#x20;

Blink users can do both, send to Lightning Addresses and receive payments from other wallets who support sending to Lightning Address.

You can find an overview of the various Lightning Wallets and their support for Lightning Address [here](https://github.com/andrerfneves/lightning-address/blob/master/README.md#wallets-supported).
