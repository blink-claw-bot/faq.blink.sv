# How can I use Blink's Point of Sale (PoS or Cash Register) feature?

There are two ways to use the Blink Point of Sale:

**Option 1:**

1. Click on the menu in the top right of your Blink home screen
2. Click on "Ways to get paid"
3. Here you will find your v link
4. You can share this link with your employees, clients, or add it directly to your social media, website, or blog to receive payments.

**Option 2:**

1. Go to [pay.blink.sv](https://pay.blink.sv/)
2. Enter your Blink username or Log in with Blink
3. Start receiving payments using your unique Blink Point of Sale

By using the Point of Sale, you can easily receive payments directly to both accounts (BTC / USD) without relying on a single device. It's an ideal solution for small business owners who need a functioning POS system without the added costs of traditional payment processors.
