There are two ways to use the Blink Cash Register:

**Option 1:**

1. Click on the menu in the top right of your Blink home screen
2. Click on "Ways to get paid"
3. Here you will find your Cash Register link
4. You can share this link with your employees, clients, or add it directly to your social media, website, or blog to receive payments.

**Option 2:**

1. Go to[ pay.blink.sv](https://pay.blink.sv/)
2. Enter your Blink username
3. Start receiving payments using your unique Blink Cash Register

By using the Cash Register, you can easily receive payments directly to both accounts (BTC / USD) without relying on a single device. It's an ideal solution for small business owners who need a functioning POS system without the added costs of traditional payment processors.
