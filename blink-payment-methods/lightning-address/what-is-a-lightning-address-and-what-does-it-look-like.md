# What is a Lightning Address, and what does it look like?

Lightning Addresses are a type of Lightning Network payment request based on the LNURL protocol that allows users to receive bitcoin payments directly to their Lightning wallet. They look just like an email address, but instead of emails, you can receive Lightning payments with it.

Lightning Addresses can look different depending on the service that the payment recipient uses.&#x20;

For example, a Blink user's Lightning Address will look like username@blink.sv, while a Wallet of Satoshi user's Lightning Address might look like username@walletofsatoshi.com.&#x20;

Regardless of the format, all Lightning Addresses are unique to the recipient, allowing them to receive Lightning payments securely and easily.
