# Where can I verify the status of an on-chain transaction?

You can verify the status of an on-chain transaction by using a blockchain explorer like [mempool.com](https://mempool.com). A blockchain explorer is a tool that allows you to search and view all the transactions that have occurred on the Bitcoin blockchain.

To check the status of your transaction, you will need the transaction ID or hash. This information can usually be found in your wallet transaction history or on the transaction confirmation page.

Once you have the transaction ID or hash, you can enter it into a blockchain explorer search bar, and it will show you the details of the transaction, including the number of confirmations and the current status.
