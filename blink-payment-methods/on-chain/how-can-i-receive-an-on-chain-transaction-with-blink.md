# How can I receive an on-chain transaction with Blink?

To receive an on-chain transaction using Blink, follow these steps:

1. Open the Blink app and click on "Receive".
2. Under the QR code click on "Use a Bitcoin on-chain address"
3. You can copy the address, share it, or show the QR code to the sender.
4. Once the transaction has been sent, you can ask for a HASH text to verify the success of the transaction. This HASH text is a unique identifier that confirms the transaction has been recorded on the blockchain.
