# What are the different types of Bitcoin on-chain addresses?

Bitcoin on-chain addresses come in different formats, each with its own prefix. Here are the most common formats and their respective prefixes:

* Legacy addresses: start with "1"
* SegWit addresses: start with "3"
* Native SegWit addresses: start with "bc1" (Most common bitcoin on-chain address)

It's important to note that while different address formats may look different, they are all valid Bitcoin addresses and can be used to send and receive Bitcoin. However, some wallets and services may only support certain address formats, so it's important to verify which formats are supported before sending or receiving Bitcoin.
