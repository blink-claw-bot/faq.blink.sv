# What are some common reasons for an on-chain transaction to take a long time to confirm?

There are several reasons why an on-chain transaction may take longer than usual to confirm. Some common reasons include:

1. **Network congestion:** If there are many pending transactions on the Bitcoin network, miners may prioritize transactions with higher fees, leaving transactions with lower fees to wait longer.
2. **Low transaction fee:** If you set a low transaction fee, miners may not prioritize your transaction, leading to a longer confirmation time.

If your transaction is taking longer than expected, you can use a block explorer like mempool.com to check its status. If you are still experiencing issues, please contact our support team for assistance at [support@blink.sv](mailto:support@bbw.sv) or by Whatsapp (+503 6983-5117).
