# How can I send an on-chain transaction with Blink?

To send an on-chain transaction with Blink, please follow these steps:

1. Open the Blink app and click on the "Send" button.
2. Enter the recipient's Bitcoin on-chain address or scan their QR code.
3. Input the amount you want to send and double-check the address.
4. Choose the transaction fee you prefer (Blink automatically suggests a fee, but you can also set it manually).
5. Click on the "Send" button to complete the transaction.
6. Once the transaction is confirmed, you can share the transaction ID (also known as the HASH) with the recipient as proof of the successful transaction.

Note that on-chain transactions may take some time to confirm on the Bitcoin network, depending on the current network traffic and the transaction fee you chose.
