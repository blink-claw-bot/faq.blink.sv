# How can I send an on-chain transaction with Blink?

To send an on-chain transaction with Blink, please follow these steps:

1. Open the Blink app and click on the `Send` button.
2. Enter the recipient's Bitcoin on-chain address or scan their QR code.
3. Choose if you want to spend from your BTC or Stablesats (USD) account.
4. Input the amount you want to send and an optional note for yourself.
5. Tap `Next` and double check the details.
6. Move the slider to the right to complete the transaction.
7. Once the transaction is confirmed, you can share the transaction ID (also known as the `hash` or `txid`) with the recipient as a proof of the successful transaction.

If the mining fees calculated are more than the 10% of the amount you are preparing to send Blink will show a notification: `High fee! We recommend Lightning.`

Note that on-chain transactions may take some time to confirm on the Bitcoin network, depending on the current network traffic and the transaction fees chosen.
