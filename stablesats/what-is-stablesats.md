# What is Stablesats?

**Stablesats** is a feature that aims to address the issue of short-term volatility in the Bitcoin economy. When the exchange rate of Bitcoin drops, it can affect the purchasing power of sats, making it difficult for people to pay for goods and services priced in dollars. This can lead to merchants and consumers frequently selling their Bitcoin for dollars to ensure they can meet their financial obligations.

To overcome this problem, Stablesats offers a USD account that users can use to hold "dollar-equivalent" balances in their Lightning wallet. This helps to protect users from fluctuations in the Bitcoin exchange rate, allowing them to conduct transactions with greater confidence and convenience. Stablesats aims to make it easier for people to use Bitcoin as a currency for everyday transactions, without having to worry about the short-term volatility of the market.\

It's important to note that this feature cannot be disabled. If users prefer to keep everything in Bitcoin, they should remember to select their default wallet as Bitcoin in the settings under Default account. The chosen account is set for both receiving and sending transactions.
