# Is Stablesats compatible with the traditional banking system?

To date, Stablesats is only compatible with the Bitcoin payment network and does not directly integrate with traditional banking systems. This is because Stablesats is designed to operate within the Lightning Network, a layer-2 protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. As a result, Stablesats users can enjoy the benefits of holding dollar-equivalent balances in their Lightning wallet without relying on stablecoins or direct fiat integration.

While Stablesats may not directly interface with traditional banking systems, it mirrors the integration level of Bitcoin itself. Presently, to exchange Stablesats dollars for Dollars within the traditional banking system, it necessitates going through a BTC/USD exchange service. Despite this, Stablesats' pioneering approach to mitigating Bitcoin's short-term volatility and protecting the purchasing power of sats has attracted many Lightning Network users. With Stablesats, users can hold, send, and receive dollars within their Lightning wallet, circumventing the need for a third-party stablecoin issuer or direct integration with a traditional banking system.
