# What makes Stablesats stand out from stablecoins like Tether and USDC?

While stablecoins like Tether and USDC have become increasingly popular, they can be limited by the blockchain they are built on, and users may have to worry about which stablecoin or blockchain their counterparty uses.

Stablesats offers a unique solution to this problem, as it is fully interoperable with anyone using Bitcoin and Lightning. This means that users can hold and transact dollars without worrying about the specific blockchain or stablecoin being used by their counterparties.&#x20;

Additionally, because Stablesats uses derivatives products, it can offer a more flexible and scalable solution compared to traditional stablecoins. Overall, Stablesats provides an exciting new way to hold and transact dollars within the Bitcoin and Lightning ecosystem, offering greater flexibility and interoperability than other stablecoin options.
